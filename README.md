After her partner disappears under mysterious circumstances, it’s up to you to find the truth of what happened, all while working cases for clients.

## Game Overview

**Look:** The game is set in a 3D landscape with 2D characters, with the game being primarily a side-scroller with some limited forward and backward movement.Environmental objects may be 2D or 3D. Art style is stylized and does not mimic reality in terms of visuals. Loose inspiration pulled from Don’t Starve and similar cartoon styles, though with slightly more realistic proportions. The spirit world is largely confined to cool colors, contrasting with the player character’s warm color palette. 

**Genre:** Mystery

**Setting:** The player will primarily traverse Asphodel, a realm of spirits, as they try to solve various cases. Asphodel ranges in visual style, but the main street hub that the player character visits is inspired by New York City architecture. When not in the spirit world, the player will be located in the Psychomanteum, a dark and isolated room which serves as their gateway to Asphodel

**Art Style:** Neo-Noir

**Relevant Inspiration:**

- Ace Attorney
- Night in the Woods
- Psychonauts
- Backbone/Tail Noir

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### Free Roam Movement

The player will be able to move right, left, forward, and backward within the 3D environment. Furthermore, the game will have the player moving between various locations, which they will have free access to outside of required game events. The player will also be able to enter various buildings and access new areas. 

### Collect Evidence

The player will be able to collect evidence through interactions with the physical environment and NPCs within Asphodel. Physical items may be picked up with the interact button and stored in the journal. When interrogating NPCs, players have the chance to uncover valuable information, which will also be noted down in the journal. Both forms of evidence are key to building a case.

### Inspect Objects in 3D

All physical clues will be fully rendered and able to be inspected by the player for further information that can be brought up with NPCs or provide guidance for environmental puzzles.

### Interrogate/Talk with NPCs

Some information/evidence may only be gathered by talking with certain NPCs. When talking with an important NPC, players will be prompted to make various dialogue choices to try and compel the NPC to reveal some important evidence. If enough correct choices are made, key clues to the case may be uncovered, which will be stored in the journal for later review.

### Journal UI

The journal will consist of several different pages, each one with a different functionality. The player can navigate to these pages through bookmark tabs in the journal. The journal will initially open to the front page, which contains the Main Menu, Save, and Quit options on the left side, and a small polaroid of Iona on the right. The journal will always open to the last page that was open when it was closed. The settings page will contain options for adjusting game volume, text scroll speed, and more.


Clues will be split across two pages, objects picked up and notes, which will consist of observations and quotes from NPCs. The left side of the objects page will display a list of obtained objects, and the right side will have a detailed display of the currently selected item.

The notes page will be a bulleted list of short texts, one or two sentences long. The player will be able to strikethrough or bold these at will in order to mark a clue as more or less relevant. There will also be a section for players to write their own notes in the journal. Players will also be able to revisit clues from previous chapters using tabs on the right side of the journal.

### Time Limit

After solving the case, the player has limited time within the Asphodel, due to their position as a living person within the realm of the dead. The more time spent within Asphodel, the blurrier the line between alive and dead becomes and Polaris will begin to feel adverse effects. If too much time is spent, Polaris will be sent back to the Psychomanteum. The player can also choose to return to the Psychomanteum early. There is no time limit or adverse effects imposed before the player solves the case.

## Story and Gameplay

### Core Gameplay Loop

The gameplay loop consists of entering the spirit world and speaking with NPCs and investigating areas and objects to solve cases. The player uses their journal to keep track of various clues found. The player can revisit previous levels’ journal entries in further levels. Once a case is completed, the player is made aware that they have a certain amount of time left in Asphodel, which they may use to explore the world more if they so desire. However, the longer the player spends in Asphodel after completing the case, the more adverse effects they will face until they either return (either of their own free will or not) to the psychomanteum. From that point on, the player then begins the next case.

### Levels
